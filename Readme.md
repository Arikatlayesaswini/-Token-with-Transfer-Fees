# Token with Transfer Fees

## Project Description

A Move smart contract implementation on the Aptos blockchain that introduces a token system with configurable transfer fees. This contract enables users to create token accounts with customizable fee structures, where a percentage of each transfer is automatically deducted as a fee and sent to a designated fee collector address. The system provides a transparent and automated way to implement transaction fees within token transfers, making it suitable for various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and token economies.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a flexible and efficient fee-based token system that empowers developers and organizations to implement sustainable tokenomics with built-in revenue mechanisms. By providing a simple yet powerful smart contract for fee collection during token transfers, we aim to:

- Enable sustainable token ecosystems with automated fee collection
- Provide a foundation for DeFi protocols requiring transaction fees
- Offer transparency and fairness in fee distribution mechanisms
- Support various business models built on fee-based token transactions
- Foster innovation in blockchain-based financial applications
